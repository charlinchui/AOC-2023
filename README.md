# Advent of code 2023

### I've started a repository to document my progress on the Advent of Code 2023. It's my first time exploring Go, so bear with me if the solutions aren't super optimized – I'm treating this as my change to finally get to learn the language.
### Learning is the main reason I'm doing this, so completion times might not break any records. However, I'm still proud of the progress I am making here.

### Feel free to check out the repository, and any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome!
