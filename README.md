# Advent of code 2023

### I've started a repository to document my progress on the Advent of Code 2023. As I'm diving into Go for the first time, these solutions might not be the most optimized, but I'm excited to use this opportunity to enhance my Go skills.

### I want to emphasize that my primary goal is to learn, so the completion times may not be as fast as they could be. Nonetheless, I'm proud of the progress I'm making.

### Feel free to check out the repository, and any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome!
