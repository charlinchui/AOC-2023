# Advent of code 2023

### I've started a repository to document my progress on the Advent of Code 2023. It's my first time exploring Go, so bear with me if the solutions aren't super optimized – I'm treating this as my chance to finally learn the language, and by the way, I am still proud of the progress I am making here even if, again, the solutions are not the best out there.

### Feel free to check out the repository, and any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome!
